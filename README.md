### A Comparative Analysis of Developer Queries

Abstract — This paper deals with the analysis of the commonly asked questions and their answers from the Stack Overflow dataset to find out what PHP and JavaScript developers are commonly discussing on such popular question-and-answer (Q&A) platforms. While PHP has been around for quite some time, JavaScript is comparatively newer. This paper takes into account that both PHP and JavaScript have popular frameworks such as Laravel, Cake, Nodejs, Reactjs etc. In such a situation, we try to find answers to questions such as – the trends in questions that are being asked about these languages, who are the people (users of Stack Overflow) most likely to answer questions related to JavaScript and PHP thereby creating a recommendation system of "Answerers", what are the factors that determine whether a question will be answered, and finally, what are the factors that determine whether a question that has been answered will also eventually be "closed" i.e. successfully resolved.

### A Succinct Study on Requirements Engineering for User Interfaces

Abstract — Throughout the history of engineering practices, least amount of attention has been given to the designing and development of user interfaces. Developers and customers are so focused on maximizing functionality and performance and minimizing costs for development that the usability of the application or appliance has been overlooked too often. This paper attempts to analyze some of the past and current research being done at the intersection of various fields such as Software Engineering and Human Computer Interaction with Requirements Engineering and shed some light on existing issues in user interface designing which can be dealt with via improved requirements engineering.

### Benchmarking Modern AMQP Message Brokers

Abstract — Message broker systems have become a popular architectural choice in distributed systems, providing greater network scalability and flexibility than the traditional client-server model. This recent rise in popularity has caused countless options of broker system configurations to emerge. Broker systems vary in dimensions such as message passing scheme, broker setup, and protocols used. Most brokers claim to be robust, fast and reliable, but sometimes these claims are unsubstantiated. In addition, it is difficult to figure out the right broker that satisfies an application's requirements, thus, it becomes necessary to paint a more vivid picture of the many options available. This paper aims to give a clear view on the myriad of message broker system options available through a survey and also by benchmarking two popular systems, ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ under various workloads. These two brokers are investigated on their quality of service features such as tail latency and scalability.

### Comparative Study OpenStack Vs CloudStack

Abstract — Cloud Computing is a continuously growing technology for enterprise software development and delivery. With increasing demands among a large number of organizations for higher level of privacy and control over cloud solutions the need to have private cloud solutions has gone up. In order to attend to this need, there are several open-source efforts at developing frameworks for building public and private clouds. Among them, two of the most recognizable names these days
are OpenStack and CloudStack – both of whom are growing at a fast pace. In order to understand which of these two frameworks suits an enterprise’s needs, an extensive analysis of these frameworks is required. This paper’s main contribution is therefore an in-depth study and comparison of the cloud properties of these two open source frameworks, providing useful information that can aid in the decision making process of which framework to choose.

### Computer-Assisted Language Learning in SLA

Abstract — Computer technology has brought learning and education out of the confines of the classroom into our living rooms and public transport; off of the white board and notebooks into our hands. Alongside games and entertainment, education has also become mobile. With the process of learning no longer being the sole prerogative of institutions, research needs to focus on enhancing the quality of mobile education to match up to classroom instruction. Technology needs to work in close collaboration with language studies to explore alternate avenues as well as improve upon existing techniques to impart second language training. As such progress in Computer-Assisted Language Learning needs to align with the struggles of Second Language Acquisition to cater to the different needs of individual language learners with disparate educational, social and cultural backgrounds; playing such differences to the instructor’s and learner’s advantage rather than have them function as obstacles.

### Study on Infamous Cases of Requirements Engineering Failure

Abstract — This report looks at the impact of inadequate requirements engineering on software development through the study of two prominent instances of software failures/bugs.
